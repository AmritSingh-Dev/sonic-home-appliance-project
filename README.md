# Home Appliance Store Store/Management System

## Description

The **Home Appliance Store Store/Management System** is a Java-based application that demonstrates the use of design patterns such as **MVC** and advanced features like a **web interface** with login authentication, a shopping basket (add, remove, checkout), and a console-based menu system. It offers a seamless user experience for both a web-based frontend and a command-line backend, showcasing the versatility of Java technologies in real-world scenarios.

## Why?

Managing a home appliance store involves complex workflows like:
- Maintaining an up-to-date inventory.
- Simplifying order management and customer interactions.
- Providing a secure login system for customers and admins.
- Streamlining the checkout process through a robust shopping basket feature.

This project was born out of the need to integrate multiple functionalities into a single application. Whether you're an admin overseeing operations or a customer making purchases, this system caters to all needs while adhering to good software design principles.
